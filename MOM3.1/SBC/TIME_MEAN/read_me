                               TIME_MEAN

     This "atmos" model is an EXAMPLE of how to supply surface boundary
     conditions which are a function of latitude and longitude but not
     of time to MOM. The data it uses must be prepared using the
     run scripts in PREP_DATA. Refer to the manual.
