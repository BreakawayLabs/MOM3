This is test_case_A: A global climate-model like configuration for
MOM3 to be used only locally within GFDL.  The test case has 25
levels, and uses a 3x3 degree horizontal resolution, going to 1 degree
in latitude near the equator.  The run_mom_caseA script runs the model
for one year, using restoring to monthly Levitus data and monthly wind
stress.  The test case's main objectives are:

1) To be used for testing new updates to the code.  Each such update
   must be tested and shown to run in test_case_A before being
   accepted into the standard MOM3 distribution.

2) To make sure that the model solution remains the same with all
   physics options during the transition from MOM3 to MOM4.  


To run test_case_A on the t90:
------------------------------

    1) mkdir -p $HOME/MOM_3/EXP/TEST_CASE_A
    
    2) copy the run script to your run directory

       cp /net/rcp/MOM_3/EXP/TEST_CASE_A/run_mom_caseA $HOME/MOM_3/EXP/TEST_CASE_A/

       and change in run_mom_caseA the lines
    
       #QSUB -Gp oa1       # project 
       #QSUB -o /t90/ett/MOM_3/EXP/TEST_CASE_A/run_printout
    
       from oa1 and ett to your group project and to your userid.
    
    3) Finally, submit as a batch job:

       cd $HOME/MOM_3/EXP/TEST_CASE_A/
       gsub run_mom_caseA

    Note: the script uses rsh and rcp to get files from the archive,
          make sure you have .rhosts files on the t90/ t3e/
          workstation home directories giving permissions to the t90
          and t3e to do rsh and rcp.  That is, if your user id is ett,
          for example, you want to have .rhosts files on your
          /home/ett/, /t90/ett/ and /t3e/ett/ that have the following
          lines in them:
	  	  ett ett
		  t90 ett
		  t90-out ett
		  t94 ett
		  t94-out ett
		  t3e ett
		  t3e-out ett

    output will be found in the directory created by the script at
    $HOME/MOM_3/EXP/TEST_CASE_A/OUTPUT and it should agree with the
    sample output in the directory
    /net/rcp/MOM_3/EXP/TEST_CASE_A/OUTPUT.


To run test_case_A on the t3e:
------------------------------

At the top of the script, replace QSUB by --QSUB in the t90 part and
--QSUB by QSUB in the t90 part.  Then follow the t90 instructions
above (where now $HOME refers to the t3e home).
