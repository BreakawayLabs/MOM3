                                MOMDATA.3

     this "atmos" model is an EXAMPLE of how to supply surface
     boundary conditions which are a function of latitude, longitude
     and time to MOM. The "atmos" model grid is assumed to be of
     different resolution from MOM so interpolations of S.B.C. are
     needed. This is accomplished by specifying the "-Dcoupled" option
     when compiling MOM.

     This model is for illustrative purposes only but could be replaced
     by an atmospheric GCM, intermediate, or anomoly model.
